This research project delves into the realm of age group prediction through the analysis of voice data, utilizing a comprehensive set of audio features extracted from recordings. The objective is to discern age-related patterns within the extracted features, thereby enabling accurate age prediction. Two distinct methodologies, classical machine learning (ML) and neural networks, are explored to ascertain their effectiveness in this task.

For classical ML, a total of 23 audio features including "spectral centroid," "spectral bandwidth," "spectral_rolloff," "mfcc1" to "mfcc20," "Chroma Feature," "Spectral Contrast," "Tonnetz," and "RMS Energy" are extracted from the voice recordings. These features capture essential characteristics of the audio signals and form the basis for age prediction models. Logistic regression, Support Vector Machines (SVC), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) are implemented and evaluated as part of the classical ML approach.

In contrast, the neural network approach involves the extraction of a more extensive set of 191 audio features. This expanded feature set aims to capture intricate nuances within the voice data for enhanced predictive capabilities. Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are employed as neural network architectures to uncover complex patterns and relationships within the data.

The project evaluates and compares the performance of these methodologies, assessing their accuracy, precision, and recall in predicting age groups from voice data. Insights gained from this study contribute to our understanding of the efficacy of classical ML and neural networks in handling age prediction tasks based on audio features.
